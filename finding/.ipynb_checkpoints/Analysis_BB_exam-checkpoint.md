Based on the histograms provided, here is an analysis of the exam score distributions for U.S. students (US), International Military Students (IMS), and the combined total:

1. **IMS Exam Scores Distribution**:
   - The scores for the IMS group are heavily skewed towards the higher end, with a peak at the 100 score mark. This indicates that a significant number of IMS students scored perfectly or near-perfectly on the exam.
   - There are very few low scores, suggesting that the IMS group generally found the exam to be within their capabilities, or that they were well-prepared.

2. **US Exam Scores Distribution**:
   - The U.S. students' scores are more evenly spread out, with a slight skew towards the higher end. The peak frequency is around the 90-95 score range.
   - There is a broader range of scores among U.S. students, indicating more variability in performance compared to the IMS group.

3. **Total Exam Scores Distribution**:
   - When both groups are combined, the distribution has two peaks (bimodal), one around the 85 score range and a sharper peak at 100.
   - This bimodality could suggest that one group performed distinctly differently from the other, which is supported by the individual histograms.

**Recommendations**:
- **Review Exam Difficulty**: Given the high scores, especially among IMS students, review the exam's difficulty level to ensure it's adequately testing the desired knowledge and comprehension levels.
  
- **Investigate Preparation Levels**: The differences in score distributions suggest that there may be differences in preparation levels or prior knowledge between the two groups. Investigate the study resources and support systems available to each group.

- **Curriculum and Instruction Assessment**: If the exam is intended to be challenging, consider whether the curriculum and instruction are aligning well with the assessment, especially for the U.S. students whose scores show greater variability.

- **Consider Exam Conditions**: Since the exam was open note and open book, consider if time constraints or the nature of the exam (e.g., application vs. recall questions) are influencing the results.

- **Evaluate Scoring Consistency**: Ensure that the scoring of the exam is consistent and that there are no biases affecting the results.

- **Further Analysis**: If available, further analysis could be done using item response theory to evaluate the difficulty of individual questions and the exam's ability to discriminate between different levels of student ability.

- **Tailor Support**: For students who scored lower, consider additional support or review sessions to address gaps in knowledge.

- **Cultural or Educational Background Considerations**: If IMS students are coming from different educational backgrounds, their approach to open-note exams might be different from that of U.S. students, potentially explaining the score distribution.

- **Investigate Outliers**: For any outliers, especially in the U.S. group, investigate if there were any external factors affecting those students' performance.

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement feedback mechanisms for students to share their experiences of the exam to gain insights into how they prepared and their thoughts on the exam difficulty.

By examining not just the overall scores but also the distribution and the conditions of the exam, you can gain a better understanding of both groups' performance and make informed decisions to enhance the learning and assessment process.
