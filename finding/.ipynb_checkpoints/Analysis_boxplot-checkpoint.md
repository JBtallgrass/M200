# boxplot representing the distribution of CTGL

across different teams, labeled 1 through 19. Hereâ€™s what the boxplot tells us:

1. **Central Tendency and Spread**:
   - Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of the scores for a team, which is the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3).
   - The line inside the box shows the median score for each team.
   - Teams with taller boxes have a greater spread in scores, indicating more variability among the team members' CTGL scores.

2. **Outliers**:
   - The points outside the 'whiskers' (the lines extending from the top and bottom of each box) represent outliers, which are scores that fall significantly higher or lower than the rest of the data.
   - Some teams, like Team 0 and Team 6, have outliers below the lower whisker, indicating a few team members with unusually low scores.

3. **Comparison Across Teams**:
   - Teams are colored differently, possibly to distinguish between different groups or to enhance visual separation.
   - Teams with higher median scores (line inside the box) have generally higher performance on the CTGL metric.
   - Some teams have very compact distributions, indicating consistent performance among team members, while others show more diversity in scores.

4. **Whiskers**:
   - The whiskers extend to the furthest points within 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles, except for outliers.
   - Teams with longer whiskers indicate a wider range of scores within the central 50% of the data.

5. **Symmetry**:
   - Some boxes are symmetric around the median, suggesting a more even distribution of scores.
   - Asymmetric boxes, where one half of the box is longer than the other, indicate a skew in the data; for example, if the top half of the box is longer, it means more scores are distributed towards the higher end.

This type of visualization is helpful for quickly comparing the central tendency and variability of scores across multiple groups, identifying outliers, and assessing the overall distribution of scores. It provides a clear visual comparison of how different teams perform in terms of CTGL scores and can highlight teams that may require additional attention or investigation due to their variability or the presence of outliers.
