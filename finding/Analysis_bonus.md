Given the provided information and assuming access to the underlying dataframes, here are some additional analyses that could provide deeper insights:

1. **Item Analysis**:
   - Analyze individual exam question performance to identify any questions that were particularly easy or difficult for each group. This can help in understanding whether certain topics need more instructional focus.

2. **Subgroup Performance**:
   - If demographic or educational background data are available, perform subgroup analyses to see if there are patterns in performance based on these factors.

3. **Statistical Tests**:
   - Conduct hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) to determine if the differences in scores between US and IMS students are statistically significant.
   - Use ANOVA if there are more than two groups (subgroups within US or IMS students) to compare.

4. **Regression Analysis**:
   - If there are additional variables (like hours of study, previous coursework, English proficiency, etc.), use regression analysis to see which factors are strong predictors of exam scores.

5. **Pre- and Post-Exam Surveys**:
   - If pre- and post-exam survey data are available, analyze these to understand students' confidence levels, study habits, and perceptions of the exam's difficulty.

6. **Time Analysis**:
   - If you have timing data on how long students took to complete the exam, analyze this in relation to scores to see if there is a correlation between time spent and exam performance.

7. **Learning Outcomes Alignment**:
   - Align the exam questions with specific learning outcomes to determine if there are certain learning objectives that are not being met by all students.

8. **Cohort Analysis**:
   - Compare this exam's performance data with previous cohorts to see if the patterns are consistent or if there have been changes over time.

9. **Consistency with Other Assessments**:
   - Compare exam scores with other forms of assessment (projects, participation, other exams) to check for consistency in performance.

10. **Qualitative Data Analysis**:
    - Analyze any qualitative feedback from students about the exam to identify common themes or concerns.

11. **Difficulty Index and Discrimination Index**:
    - Calculate the difficulty index (proportion of students who answered correctly) and discrimination index (ability of a question to differentiate between high and low scorers) for each question to refine the assessment tool.

12. **Heatmaps or Correlation Analysis**:
    - Create heatmaps to find correlations between different assessment metrics or between student behaviors (like study time) and exam scores.

13. **Cluster Analysis**:
    - Use cluster analysis to identify groups of students with similar performance profiles, which could inform targeted interventions.

14. **Learning Analytics**:
    - If the exam was administered online, use learning analytics to understand patterns in how students engaged with the material and the exam.

Before performing these analyses, ensure data privacy standards are upheld, especially if dealing with identifiable student information. Each analysis should be driven by specific questions or hypotheses about student performance, instructional design, or assessment validity.
