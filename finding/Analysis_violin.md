# Violin plots 

Representing the distribution of CTGL scores across different teams, labeled from 1 to 19 (with some numbers missing, possibly indicating that there is no data for those teams or they have been excluded for some reason).

Here's what we can infer from this plot:

1. **Score Distribution**: The violin plots show the distribution of CTGL scores within each team. The width of the plot at different score levels indicates the density of data points, with wider sections meaning more data points at that score level.

2. **Median Scores**: The white dot in the center of each violin plot likely represents the median score for that team. The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of the data.

3. **Interquartile Range**: The thick black bar within the violin plot indicates the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). This shows where the middle 50% of scores lie.

4. **Score Range**: The thin line extending from the IQR shows the range of the data, excluding outliers. It indicates the spread of scores from the lowest to the highest within each team.

5. **Comparing Teams**: 
   - Teams with narrower violins have less variability in their scores, while wider violins indicate more variability.
   - Some teams have a larger range of scores (longer thin lines), while others are more compact, suggesting consistency in scores.

6. **Outliers**: If there are any points outside the thin lines, those would be considered outliers, but they are not visible in this plot.

7. **Symmetry and Skewness**: 
   - The symmetry of the violin plot around the median can indicate the skewness of the distribution. A symmetrical violin suggests a fairly even distribution of scores above and below the median.
   - If one side of the violin is longer or fatter, this indicates skewness in the scores towards higher or lower values.

8. **Team Performance**:
   - Teams towards the right (with higher team numbers) seem to have higher medians and less variability, suggesting potentially better performance or grading standards.
   - Teams on the left have lower median scores and more variability, which could indicate more diverse performance within the team or different scoring standards.

This plot is useful for comparing the performance of different teams, understanding the distribution of scores within each team, and quickly identifying any teams with particularly high or low scores, or with unusual distributions such as a single team with a bimodal distribution. It can help in identifying teams that may need additional support or recognition.
