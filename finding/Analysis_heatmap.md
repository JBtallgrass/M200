# correlation heatmap of assessments.

Here's an analysis of the heatmap:

1. **Color Scheme**: The heatmap uses a color gradient from blue to red to represent correlation values between -1.0 and 1.0. Blue indicates a negative correlation, red indicates a positive correlation, and white or pale colors indicate a low or no correlation.

2. **Variables**:
   - **CTGL**: Appears to be a type of score or metric.
   - **Wt_total**: Likely represents a weighted total.
   - **Total_pts**: May represent total points.
   - **BB_exam_us**: Could be a score from a specific exam or assessment, possibly "US" stands for a user score or a score from a section.
   - **BB_exam_ims**: Similar to BB_exam_us, but "ims" might represent a different type of score or from a different section.
   - **Combined_Scores**: Likely a metric that combines various scores.

3. **Correlations**:
   - **High Positive Correlations**: 
      - Wt_total and BB_exam_us have a perfect correlation of 1.00, which suggests they are effectively measuring the same thing or are directly related to each other.
      - Wt_total also has a very high correlation (0.91) with Combined_Scores, indicating a strong relationship.
      - BB_exam_us and Combined_Scores also show a perfect correlation, implying that the combined score is heavily influenced by the BB_exam_us score.
   
   - **Moderate Positive Correlations**:
      - CTGL has moderate correlations with Wt_total (0.42), Total_pts (0.50), and BB_exam_ims (0.54), suggesting some level of relationship.
      - Wt_total and Total_pts are moderately correlated (0.46), suggesting they share some common factors but also have distinct components.
      - BB_exam_ims has a moderate correlation with Combined_Scores (0.63), indicating it is a component of the combined score but not as strongly weighted as BB_exam_us.

   - **Low or No Correlation**:
      - CTGL has a very low correlation with BB_exam_us (0.06) and Combined_Scores (0.06), suggesting that whatever CTGL is measuring, it is largely independent of these particular exam scores.
      - BB_exam_ims and Total_pts have a low correlation (0.22), which suggests they measure different aspects or outcomes.
      - BB_exam_ims has a slightly negative correlation with BB_exam_us (-0.09), which is unexpected given they are both exam scores; this could indicate they are designed to measure completely different competencies.

4. **Diagonal**: The diagonal from the top left to the bottom right shows perfect correlations (1.00) as it is correlating each variable with itself.

This heatmap is useful for understanding the relationships between different assessment metrics. If this is from an educational setting, such data could help educators understand how different assessments contribute to overall scores and identify if any assessments are redundant. The strong correlations between some of the variables suggest that some of the metrics may be redundant. For instance, since Wt_total, BB_exam_us, and Combined_Scores are all perfectly or almost perfectly correlated, they might be representing the same underlying performance metric.
