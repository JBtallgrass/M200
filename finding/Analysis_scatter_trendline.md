# Scatter plot: CTGL and Wt_total, 

with each point representing an observation. The points are colored by "Team", which is likely a categorical variable that identifies different groups within the data.

Here's an analysis of the scatter plot:

1. **CTGL vs. Wt_total Relationship**: 
   - The plot shows a positive correlation between CTGL and Wt_total, as evidenced by the upward trend of the data points. This means that higher values of Wt_total are generally associated with higher values of CTGL.

2. **Trend Line**: 
   - A trend line (likely a linear regression line) is included in the plot, which models the relationship between CTGL and Wt_total. The shaded area around the trend line represents the confidence interval for this prediction, suggesting where future data points are expected to fall, given the current data.

3. **Team Distribution**: 
   - The different colors represent different teams. The distribution of colors shows how the teams are spread across the range of Wt_total and CTGL values. Some teams may have a wider spread of scores, indicating more variability within those teams.

4. **Data Clustering**:
   - There appears to be clustering of data points around certain values of Wt_total, which might indicate common scoring benchmarks or grading standards.

5. **Outliers**:
   - If any data points are significantly far from the trend line or other points, they would be considered outliers. Outliers can indicate special cases or errors in the data.

6. **Inter-Team Comparison**:
   - It can be observed whether some teams consistently score higher or lower on both metrics, or if there is a lot of overlap between teams.

7. **Scale and Axes**: 
   - The x-axis represents Wt_total with values ranging approximately from 80 to 100, while the y-axis represents CTGL with values from the high 80s to 100. The axes' scales allow for a detailed view of the data's distribution.

This type of visualization is useful for understanding the relationship between two continuous variables and how they might be affected by a categorical group variable. It can also help identify trends, patterns, or anomalies in the data across different subgroups.
