# The relationship between CTGL and Wt_total:

 with the data points color-coded by Team, ranging from Team 1 to Team 19. This visualization provides additional context and insights:

1. **Clustering by Team**:
   - The data points are color-coded by team, which allows for an easy visual comparison of where each team's members fall on the CTGL vs. Wt_total spectrum.
   - Some teams may cluster tightly together, suggesting consistency within those teams in terms of their CTGL and Wt_total scores.
   - Other teams may have a broader distribution, which could indicate more variability in performance within those teams.

2. **Range of Scores**:
   - The plot shows the range of scores for each team across the Wt_total and CTGL metrics. This can help identify if certain teams generally score higher or lower than others.

3. **Correlation**:
   - While the previous image included a trend line, this plot does not seem to have one. However, it still provides a visual representation of the relationship between the two variables. If the points for each team tend to move upwards to the right, this suggests a positive correlation.

4. **Outliers**:
   - Any points that fall far from the main cluster of their respective team color could be considered outliers. These may be points of interest for further investigation.

5. **Visual Clarity**:
   - Without a trend line, this scatter plot gives a clean look at the raw data distributions, which can be useful for seeing the natural groupings and spread without the influence of a fitted model.

6. **Comparison with Previous Images**:
   - Compared to the previous images, this scatter plot allows us to look at the team-specific distributions without superimposed trend lines, which could give a clearer picture of each team's performance distribution.

In summary, this scatter plot continues to add depth to the analysis by showing the individual data points for each team, which can help identify patterns, consistency within teams, and outliers that may warrant further investigation.
