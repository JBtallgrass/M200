## The distribution of weighted total scores for the MOD 2 phase of the Advanced Operation Course. 

Here's an analysis of the plot:

![Weighted total plot](figure/m200_df_wt_ttl.png)

1. **Central Tendency**: The distribution of weighted totals peaks around 92.5 to 95, indicating that the average score is likely within this range. This central peak suggests that most students are achieving scores in the A range, assuming a typical grading scale.

2. **Spread**: The distribution covers a range of scores from approximately 82.5 to 100, with most of the data concentrated around the peak. This relatively narrow spread indicates that the scores are not highly dispersed and most students have scored within a relatively close range to each other.

3. **Shape**: The distribution appears to be roughly symmetrical around its central peak, suggesting a normal-like distribution of scores. This symmetry is generally a sign of fair assessment across the student population.

4. **Skewness**: There does not appear to be a pronounced skew in either direction, although there is a slight tail towards the lower scores, indicating a few students scored lower than the majority.

5. **Outliers**: The histogram does not show any significant outliers; all scores seem to fall within an expected range. There are no separate, individual bars distant from the main body of the distribution, which would indicate outliers.

From this analysis, a few insights can be gained:

- **Consistent Performance**: The concentration of scores around the 92.5 to 95 range suggests consistent performance among students, possibly indicating that the course content and assessments are well-calibrated to the students' level of expertise.

- **Effective Teaching**: The lack of a significant number of low scores could imply effective teaching methodologies and/or student preparation for the course.

- **Assessment Review**: The normal-like distribution of scores might suggest that the assessment was fair and appropriately challenging for the cohort. However, if the assessment aims to differentiate more significantly among students, it may need to be reviewed to ensure it is capable of doing so.

- **Student Support**: Students scoring at the lower end of the distribution may require additional support. It might be helpful to investigate if there are common challenges or topics that were more difficult for these students.

- **Grading Scale Review**: If this distribution does not align with expected outcomes, consider reviewing the grading scale or the difficulty of the assessments to ensure they are aligned with the learning objectives of the course.

- **Curricular Adjustments**: If the course intends to have a greater differentiation in performance (i.e., a wider spread of scores), curricular adjustments may be required to provide a range of challenges that can distinguish between varying levels of student mastery.

## "Division Movement Plan" submitted by students. 

![Division Movement Plan](figure/m200_df_div_mvmnt.png)

Here’s an analysis of what this tells you and what can be gained from this analysis:

1. **Central Tendency**: The distribution has a very sharp peak around the 92.5 score range, indicating that a large number of students received scores around this point. This suggests that the modal score (the most frequently occurring score) is in this region.

2. **Spread**: The scores span from just above 80 to 100, but the distribution is not uniform. There are two noticeable peaks (bimodal distribution), one around 92.5 and a less pronounced one around 97.5. This could imply that there are two subgroups within the student population achieving these scores, possibly reflecting different levels of understanding or application of the concepts required for the Division Movement Plan.

3. **Skewness**: The distribution shows a slight left (negative) skew, with a tail extending towards the lower scores. However, the peak at 97.5 also suggests a significant number of high-scoring submissions.

4. **Outliers**: The histogram does not show individual data points, so it’s not possible to identify specific outliers from this visual alone. However, the bars at the extremities (low and high ends) suggest that there are students who scored significantly differently than the main group.

What can be gained from this analysis:

- **Assessment of Instruction**: The concentration of scores around 92.5 may indicate that the instructions or the criteria for the Division Movement Plan were well understood by most students. However, the presence of a secondary peak and a long tail suggests that the instruction or the assessment criteria might not have been equally clear or accessible to all students.

- **Instructional Review**: The presence of a bimodal distribution could warrant a review of the instructional methods or materials provided. It may be beneficial to check if there were any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the way the assignment was presented or explained.

- **Further Investigation**: The bimodal nature of the distribution may be an indication that different groups of students have interpreted the task in different ways, or that there may have been variations in the level of support or resources available to different students.

- **Targeted Support**: Students who have scored in the lower range may benefit from additional support or feedback to understand where they may have missed the mark.

- **Rubric Refinement**: If a standardized rubric was used for scoring, the bimodal distribution could suggest that the rubric may need refinement to ensure it accurately captures the range of student performance and provides clear differentiation between different levels of achievement.

- **Feedback and Reflection**: This distribution provides an opportunity to collect feedback from students about their understanding of the assignment and the challenges they faced. It also allows for reflection on teaching practices and the clarity of the assignment guidelines.

- **Grade Calibration**: If multiple graders were involved, the distribution could suggest a need for calibration sessions to ensure that all graders are applying the scoring criteria consistently.

The analysis suggests that while many students performed well, there is a range of performances that could be further explored to enhance teaching, learning, and assessment practices.

## Distribution of CTGL scores. Here's an analysis of the histogram:

![Distribution of CTGL scores](finding/Analysis_CTGL.md)

1. **Central Tendency**:
   - The distribution has a clear mode around the score of 96, which appears to be the most frequent score range.
   - There seems to be a slight left skew to the distribution, with more scores concentrated on the higher end towards 100.

2. **Spread**:
   - The scores range from the mid-80s to a perfect score of 100, with the majority of scores falling between 94 and 98.
   - The spread of the distribution indicates some variability in scores but with a tendency towards higher performance.

3. **Shape**:
   - The histogram is not perfectly symmetrical and shows a slight skew to the left, indicating that fewer students received lower scores.
   - The tail on the left side (lower scores) is longer than the right side (higher scores), which also indicates a negative skew.

4. **Peaks**:
   - The distribution appears to be unimodal with one clear peak, suggesting that scores tend to cluster around this modal range.
   - There is a small rise again near the perfect score of 100, which could indicate a secondary cluster of high achievers.

5. **Outliers**:
   - There are no extreme outliers on the higher end, but the lower frequency of scores on the left might be considered mild outliers.

6. **Implications**:
   - The concentration of scores at the high end suggests that the assessment may not be challenging enough, as a significant number of students are scoring in the upper ranges.
   - If the assessment's purpose is to differentiate among students' levels of mastery, the current distribution suggests that it may not be fully effective in that regard.

**Recommendations**:
- **Review Assessment Content**: Consider whether the assessment is challenging enough or if it aligns well with the intended learning outcomes.
- **Differentiation**: If there is a need to differentiate more effectively between varying levels of student performance, consider revising the exam to include more challenging or diverse question types.
- **Instructional Review**: Investigate if the instruction prior to the exam has been particularly effective, leading to high scores, or if the exam format (such as open book/note) allows for higher performance.
- **Further Analysis**: Conduct a more detailed item analysis to see if certain questions were too easy or not discriminating enough between different levels of student understanding.
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Ensure that the curriculum is rigorous and that the assessment is a true reflection of students' understanding and not just their test-taking abilities.

Overall, the distribution suggests that most students performed well on this CTGL assessment, with a tendency towards higher scores. This can be a positive indication of students' understanding and preparation, but it might also signal a need to adjust the assessment's difficulty to ensure it's challenging and discriminating effectively across the spectrum of student ability.

## CTGL further inputs and analysis

The term "Contribution to Group Learning," often associated with participation grades, is a subjective measure used in educational settings to assess the extent and quality of a student's engagement in the learning process, particularly within group activities or discussions. Here's an analysis of how a standardized rubric can support the assessment of "Contribution to Group Learning" (CTGL) and its implications:

1. **Objective Criteria**: A standardized rubric can provide objective criteria for what constitutes effective participation. This can range from the frequency of contributions to the relevance and constructiveness of a student's input. It mitigates the subjectivity often associated with participation grades.

2. **Equity in Assessment**: Without a standardized rubric, participation grades can be susceptible to bias, whether intentional or unconscious. A rubric ensures that all students are aware of how their participation is being evaluated and what is expected of them.

3. **Enhanced Feedback**: By defining specific levels of performance, a rubric can help educators provide more detailed and actionable feedback to students. Instead of a generic "good participation" comment, instructors can point to specific behaviors and contributions that were either exemplary or in need of improvement.

4. **Self-Assessment and Reflection**: Rubrics can be shared with students, allowing them to self-assess and reflect on their own contributions to group learning. This can encourage students to take a more active role in their learning process.

5. **Consistency Across Teams**: In group projects, a standardized rubric ensures that all teams are evaluated on the same criteria, which is particularly important if the CTGL score is used to bolster other assessments. It helps maintain a standard of fairness across different groups.

6. **Performance Improvement**: With clear expectations outlined, students may be more motivated to engage in the learning process, which can lead to overall improvement in class dynamics and learning outcomes.

7. **Documentation for Grade Disputes**: Should a student question their participation grade, the rubric provides a documented rationale for the grade they received, which can be useful in resolving disputes.

8. **Supporting Lower Performances**: In cases where a student's performance on other assessments is lower than expected, a well-defined CTGL can serve as a means to recognize the student's other valuable contributions to the learning environment. However, it should be applied consistently to avoid inflation of grades without merit.

In the context of the histograms you provided, if CTGL scores are being used to supplement assessment grades, a standardized rubric becomes essential to ensure that this contribution is measured fairly and consistently. If CTGL scores are not currently based on a standardized rubric, the histograms might reflect inconsistencies in grading participation across different groups or instructors. Implementing a rubric could help normalize this distribution, making the CTGL scores a more reliable indicator of student engagement.
