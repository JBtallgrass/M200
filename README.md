## The distribution of weighted total scores for the MOD 2 phase of the Advanced Operation Course. 

Here's an analysis of the plot:

![Weighted total plot]([figure\m200_df_wt_ttl.png](https://github.com/JBtallgrass/M200/blob/main/figure/m200_df_wt_ttl.png)

1. **Central Tendency**: The distribution of weighted totals peaks around 92.5 to 95, indicating that the average score is likely within this range. This central peak suggests that most students are achieving scores in the A range, assuming a typical grading scale.

2. **Spread**: The distribution covers a range of scores from approximately 82.5 to 100, with most of the data concentrated around the peak. This relatively narrow spread indicates that the scores are not highly dispersed and most students have scored within a relatively close range to each other.

3. **Shape**: The distribution appears to be roughly symmetrical around its central peak, suggesting a normal-like distribution of scores. This symmetry is generally a sign of fair assessment across the student population.

4. **Skewness**: There does not appear to be a pronounced skew in either direction, although there is a slight tail towards the lower scores, indicating a few students scored lower than the majority.

5. **Outliers**: The histogram does not show any significant outliers; all scores seem to fall within an expected range. There are no separate, individual bars distant from the main body of the distribution, which would indicate outliers.

From this analysis, a few insights can be gained:

- **Consistent Performance**: The concentration of scores around the 92.5 to 95 range suggests consistent performance among students, possibly indicating that the course content and assessments are well-calibrated to the students' level of expertise.

- **Effective Teaching**: The lack of a significant number of low scores could imply effective teaching methodologies and/or student preparation for the course.

- **Assessment Review**: The normal-like distribution of scores might suggest that the assessment was fair and appropriately challenging for the cohort. However, if the assessment aims to differentiate more significantly among students, it may need to be reviewed to ensure it is capable of doing so.

- **Student Support**: Students scoring at the lower end of the distribution may require additional support. It might be helpful to investigate if there are common challenges or topics that were more difficult for these students.

- **Grading Scale Review**: If this distribution does not align with expected outcomes, consider reviewing the grading scale or the difficulty of the assessments to ensure they are aligned with the learning objectives of the course.

- **Curricular Adjustments**: If the course intends to have a greater differentiation in performance (i.e., a wider spread of scores), curricular adjustments may be required to provide a range of challenges that can distinguish between varying levels of student mastery.

## "Division Movement Plan" submitted by students.

Here’s an analysis of what this tells you and what can be gained from this analysis:

1. **Central Tendency**: The distribution has a very sharp peak around the 92.5 score range, indicating that a large number of students received scores around this point. This suggests that the modal score (the most frequently occurring score) is in this region.

2. **Spread**: The scores span from just above 80 to 100, but the distribution is not uniform. There are two noticeable peaks (bimodal distribution), one around 92.5 and a less pronounced one around 97.5. This could imply that there are two subgroups within the student population achieving these scores, possibly reflecting different levels of understanding or application of the concepts required for the Division Movement Plan.

3. **Skewness**: The distribution shows a slight left (negative) skew, with a tail extending towards the lower scores. However, the peak at 97.5 also suggests a significant number of high-scoring submissions.

4. **Outliers**: The histogram does not show individual data points, so it’s not possible to identify specific outliers from this visual alone. However, the bars at the extremities (low and high ends) suggest that there are students who scored significantly differently than the main group.

What can be gained from this analysis:

- **Assessment of Instruction**: The concentration of scores around 92.5 may indicate that the instructions or the criteria for the Division Movement Plan were well understood by most students. However, the presence of a secondary peak and a long tail suggests that the instruction or the assessment criteria might not have been equally clear or accessible to all students.

- **Instructional Review**: The presence of a bimodal distribution could warrant a review of the instructional methods or materials provided. It may be beneficial to check if there were any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the way the assignment was presented or explained.

- **Further Investigation**: The bimodal nature of the distribution may be an indication that different groups of students have interpreted the task in different ways, or that there may have been variations in the level of support or resources available to different students.

- **Targeted Support**: Students who have scored in the lower range may benefit from additional support or feedback to understand where they may have missed the mark.

- **Rubric Refinement**: If a standardized rubric was used for scoring, the bimodal distribution could suggest that the rubric may need refinement to ensure it accurately captures the range of student performance and provides clear differentiation between different levels of achievement.

- **Feedback and Reflection**: This distribution provides an opportunity to collect feedback from students about their understanding of the assignment and the challenges they faced. It also allows for reflection on teaching practices and the clarity of the assignment guidelines.

- **Grade Calibration**: If multiple graders were involved, the distribution could suggest a need for calibration sessions to ensure that all graders are applying the scoring criteria consistently.

The analysis suggests that while many students performed well, there is a range of performances that could be further explored to enhance teaching, learning, and assessment practices.
